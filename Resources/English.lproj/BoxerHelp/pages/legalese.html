					<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I25UeVXrEHQ">GNU General Public License</a></h3>
					<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
					
					<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
					59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA	02111-1307	USA<br>
						 
					<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
					 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section><a name="legalese-gpl-preamble"></a>
					<h4>Preamble</h4>
					
					<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
					freedom to share and change it.	 By contrast, the GNU General Public
					License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
					software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.	This
					General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
					Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
					using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
					the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
					your programs, too.</p>
					
					<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
					price.	Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
					have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
					this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
					if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
					in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
					
					<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
					anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
					These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
					distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
					
					<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
					gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
					you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
					source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
					rights.</p>
					
					<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
					(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
					distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
					
					<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
					that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
					software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
					want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
					that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
					authors' reputations.</p>
					
					<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
					patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
					program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
					program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
					patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
					
					<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
					modification follow.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section><a name="legalese-gpl-terms"></a>
					<h4>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
					TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4>
					
					<ol start="0">
						<li>
							<p>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
							a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
							under the terms of this General Public License.	 The "Program", below,
							refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
							means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
							that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
							either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
							language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
							the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
						
							<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
							covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
							running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
							is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
							Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
							Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
							source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
							conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
							copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
							notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
							and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
							along with the Program.</p>
						
							<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
							you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
							of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
							distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
							above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
							
							<ol>
								<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
								 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
							
								 <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
								 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
								 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
								 parties under the terms of this License.</li>
							
								 <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
								 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
								 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
								 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
								 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
								 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
								 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
								 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
								 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
								 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
							identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
							and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
							themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
							sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
							distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
							on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
							this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
							entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
							
							<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
							your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
							exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
							collective works based on the Program.</p>
							
							<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
							with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
							a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
							the scope of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
							under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
							Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
						
							<ol>
								<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
								source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
								1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>
								<li>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
								years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
								cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
								machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
								distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
								customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>
							
								<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
								to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
								allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
								received the program in object code or executable form with such
								an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</li>
							</ol>
						
							<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
							making modifications to it.	 For an executable work, complete source
							code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
							associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
							control compilation and installation of the executable.	 However, as a
							special exception, the source code distributed need not include
							anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
							form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
							operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
							itself accompanies the executable.</p>
						
							<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
							access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
							access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
							distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
							compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
							except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
							otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
							void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
							However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
							this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
							parties remain in full compliance.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
							signed it.	However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
							distribute the Program or its derivative works.	 These actions are
							prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
							modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
							Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
							all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
							the Program or works based on it.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
							Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
							original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
							these terms and conditions.	 You may not impose any further
							restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
							You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
							this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
							infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
							conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
							otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
							excuse you from the conditions of this License.	 If you cannot
							distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
							License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
							may not distribute the Program at all.	For example, if a patent
							license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
							all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
							the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
							refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
							any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
							apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
							circumstances.</p>
						
							<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
							patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
							such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
							integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
							implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
							generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
							through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
							system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
							to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
							impose that choice.</p>
						
							<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
							be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
							certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
							original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
							may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
							those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
							countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
							the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
							of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
							be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
							address new problems or concerns.</p>
						
							<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.	If the Program
							specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
							later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
							either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
							Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
							this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
							Foundation.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
							programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
							to ask for permission.	For software which is copyrighted by the Free
							Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
							make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
							of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
							of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

					<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>
					
					<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
					possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
					free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
					
					<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
					to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
					convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
					the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
					
					<blockquote id="legalese-gpl-usage-example">
						<p>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
						Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
					
						<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
						it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
						the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
						(at your option) any later version.</p>
					
						<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
						but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
						MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
						GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
					
						<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
						along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
						Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</p>
					</blockquote>
				
					<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
				
					<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
				
					<p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year	name of author<br>
					Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
					This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
					under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.</p>
				
					<p>The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
				
					<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.	Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
				
					<blockquote id="legalese-gpl-waiver-example">
						<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
					
					  	<p>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
					  	Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
					proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
					consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
					library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
					Public License instead of this License.</p>

					<p>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>

					<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
					59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
					Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
					of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
					
					<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
					as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
					the version number 2.1.]</p>
				</section>
				
				<section><a name="legalese-lgpl-preamble"></a>
					<h3>Preamble</h3>
					
					<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
					
					<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
					
					<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>
					
					<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
					
					<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
					
					<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
					
					<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.</p>
					 
					<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
					
					<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. </p>
					
					<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>
					
					<p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</p>
					
					<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
					
					<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>
					
					<p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
					
					<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section><a name="legalese-lgpl-terms"></a>
					<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
				
					<ol start="0">
						<li>
							<p>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
				
							<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
							
							<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
							
							<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>
							
							<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</p>
							<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
								
								<li>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
								
								<li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>
								
								<li>
									<p>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
									</p>

									<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							
							<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
							
							<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.</p>
							
							<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>
						
				 			<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
				 			
							<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
						</li>
				
						<li>
							<p>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
				
				 			<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
							
							<p> However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
							
							<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
				
							<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
				
							<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. </p>
							
							<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:</p>
							
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)</p>
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<p>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
									<p>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
									<p>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<p>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
				
				 			<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
				
							<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
							
							<ol>
								<li>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</li>
				
								<li>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
							
							<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances </p>
				
							<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
				
							<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
				
							<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

					<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h3>
				
				 	<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).</p>
				
					<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
				
					<blockquote id="legalese-lgpl-usage-example">
						<p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
						Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
					
						<p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
						modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
						License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
						version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
						
						<p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
						but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
						MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
						Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
						
						<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
						License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
						Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307 USA
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. </p>
					
					<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: </p>
					
					<blockquote id="legalese-lgpl-waiver-example">
						<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
						the library 'Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
						by James Random Hacker.</p>
						
						<p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990<br />
						Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
					</blockquote>
					
					<p>That's all there is to it!</p>

			<p>That’s right, “That's all there is to it!” is what the good folks at the Free Software Foundation put at the end of their license, and I’m going to assume they were being ironic because the alternative is that they seriously have no idea just how tiresome their license is or the process of releasing open-source software under it.</p>
		
			<p>I hope to God you just scrolled down here looking for a secret message, and didn't actually read through 26 pages of that horseshit.</p>
